# Greedy

This is a collection of problems that can be solved using the greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm works by making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope that these local choices will lead to a global optimum solution.

## Greedy Algorithm

The greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving strategy of making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nevertheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimum solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.

For example, consider the Coin Changing Problem where you want to make change for a particular amount using the fewest coins possible. The greedy algorithm would be to use the largest coin that does not exceed the amount, and then repeat the process with the remaining amount. This algorithm is guaranteed to produce the optimal solution.

The greedy algorithm is used in many optimization problems such as:
